## Context

The NZ Government contracts out more than $8 billion of social services to Non-Govenmental Organisations (NGO) every year. To receive funding an NGO must meet a number of standards (finances, governance, organisational health, suitability) and become an accredited provider of their service. The Provider must:

  - Understand the level of accredition they need for the service contract
  - Understand the standards necessary for the accreditation level.
  - Understand which (policy, governance etc) documents provide sufficient evidence for meeting the standards
  - Collect these documents
  - Fill out information about the organisation.
  - Send through this information to the relevant government agency.
  - Recieve site visits from the agency assesors to verify in person

This process is repeated for each contract that the Provider holds or for which the Provider applies. A Provider may have multiple contracts, with multiple agencies leading to significant reduplication of effort and staffing expense.

At the Government end the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) employs ~70 Asessors who: 

  - verify that the documents provided demonstrate sufficient evidence of the relevant standard and accreditation level.
  - communicate with the Provider when evidence is lacking or needs updating
  - coordinaite site visits.
  - stay informed about the Provider 
  - make a decision on the Providers suitability for accriditation.

These provider-assessor processes currently occur in an ad-hoc manner through pdf forms, email, and snail mail. Each agency maintains seperate data on the providers with which they contract. These data are often out-of-date.

## Opportunity: Improved Provider-Agency Interaction

Accreditron has an opportunity to create a dedicated web platform for the accreditation workflow and provides agencies with an up-to-date source of service provider information. Such an application could save millions of dollars worth of time for both providers and agencies.

## Opportunity: A social service commissioning Platform

Accreditron has a further opportunity to develop a platform for the government to gain intelligence on the social sector. A large number of providers on the same platform would make it possible to answer statistical questions about the social sector landscape useful for social sector policy-making. 

## Post Accelarator and Business Model Devlopment

Accreditron has spent 3 months validating the problems described above and bulding relationships with Providers and Government officials as part of the R9 GovTech Accellerator.

Accreditron is currently in negotiation with MSD and the Social Investment Agency (SIA) to develop the platform. We now face a challenge of discovering a sustainable business model and while managing relationships with different stakholders. The following section outlines the nature of this challenge and the suitability of governance and shareholding arrangements.


## Revenue and Investment

To recap, we anticipate the app will provide value in three areas:

1. reduce duplication in applying for accreditation, to providers
2. improve the assessor workflow, for agencies
3. provide social sector intelligence, for agencies, and other social policy stakeholders

An app with these functions is a not simple. We project early stage operating costs for Accreditron are around $500k - $600k annually for a team of 5-6. Revenue and/or capital could come from the following areas.


### Revenue from NGO's

NGO's in the social sector recieve about half of their funding from government and half from other sources (many are charities). There are a few large NGO's (e.g Salvation Army, Women's Refuge, Wise Group) and many smaller ones. The challenges of a provider subscription model for the service include:

1.  Accreditation audits occur once every two years. Most Software-as-a- Service (SaaS) offerings provide value every month. It may be difficult to get providers to pay a subcription fee for mitigating an infrequent pain point.

2. Value-based charges may be possible (pay per audit or application) but have an ongoing sales cost. 

3. Many providers have small budgets. Its likely that the large providers (who can pay) experience less pain in the application workflow as they are better organised. Smaller providers (who are less willing to pay) may experience more pain.

4. Providers view the the duplication of work as a government created problem for which the government should pay.

5. When half of provider funding comes from government asking providers to pay creates a "money-go-round". 

We estimate we could bring 500-1000 providers on to the platform per year, maybe more. Considering the context of the above challenges we do not beleive that revenue from NGO's (for the accreditation service) provides a significant revenue source and could even damage relationships with providers.

### Revenue from Social Sector Agencies

MSD and SIA have agreed to fund 9 months of development. MSD want to improve internal data sharing and assesor workflows. SIA want to gain intelligence on the social sector. 

The challenge is the Government sales cycle. Government contracts can take a 6-24 months to negotiate with a government agency with uncertain outcomes. This includes passing software security checks to allow staff to access the service. Agencies typically also spend significant sums on change management when they adopt a new tool as part of their workflows. These requirements mean Accreditron must dedicate staff and expense time to in-person sales, contract negotiation, and security audits.

After the 9 month initial build we anticpate negotiating a subscription/maintenance contract with MSD and initiate negotiations with other agencies. Subscription/maintence costs could be in the order of $20k-$200k annually per agency depending on how integral it was to agency workflows. 

A further source of potential revenue is contracts to build custom integrations with their IT systems. These could be very valuable to, or required by agencies. However, custom integrations are labour intensive, usually do not scale beyond a specific agency, and can complicate the product. We note a tension here between the needs of an agency and the need of the Accreditron business to diversify beyond short-term contracts. 

In the long run maintenance/subscription contracts could be a substantial revenue source. The problem is that Accreditron faces a funding shortfall of uncertain length **after** the initial 9 month build and **before** enough margin on maintenance contracts has kicked in.

## Capital Investment

Shortfalls are not unusual and startups often turn to to investors to fund them. Apart from the usual difficulties of raising capital from New Zealand's small Venture Capital (VC) pool we note that the challenges above would make us less atractive to VC's. In any case, getting investment can be a full time job and can take years to land. The best source of investment is revenue.

TODO: Founders can reduce their pay


## Freemium

Many Saas companies offer an inital free tier of service and a more fully-featured paid tier (freemium). Its possible that we could develop features for providers beyond accreditation for which they would be willing to pay. The NGO market is likely under-served by software vendors compared to the private sector. 

However, converion rates to premium are typcially 1-20% of the total (free + paid) user-base. Validation and development of these features may only begin after existing funders are satisfied enough and this would not solve the shortfall issue. It is unknown how much we could charge for the premium version. Many Saas products are between $200-$500/ year


# Stakeholder Tensions

Stakeholders have different needs and can pull company in different directions. We note the following tension between government and providers:

The more providers on the platform the more valuable the data and the more leverage we have in our negotations with government. Charging providers for the accreditation service means less providers sign-up and the platform is less valuable to agencies. Agencies understand that we must solve provider pain points for them to use the platform, but also want us to focus on internal integrations. 


# Fairshares

Fairshares is a model for multistakeholder cooperatives. Fairshares recognises four classes of shareholders:

 - Founders - people who establish the buiness and are [prepared to face the risks and uncertainties of doing so](https://steveblank.com/2009/06/11/am-i-founder-the-adventure-of-a-lifetime/)
 - Workers - people who contribute labour to the business
 - Users - people or groups who pay to use the service
 - Investors - people who invest financial capital into the business.

 Fairshares is unashamedly complex compared to an LLC or worker cooperatives. Individuals may hold multiple classes of shares and share classes do not have equal relationships in governaance and financial stakeholding. Ridley Duff argues that the tensions between different stakeholders will land somewhere else if they are not made explict in the constitution. 

 For example, a common tension between startup founders and early employees is the value that an employe contributes to an enterprise and their exposure to risk vs the employee's particpaton in any financial upside. These tensions are ususally negotiated on a case-by-case through share allocation vesting schemes, HR policies, performance reviews etc.

  The key benefit that fairshares has the potential to reframe the offering to providers. Instead of offering providers a choice between a free service (accreditation), and premium service (unknown) in a freemium model, we offer providers paid *membership* and share in the business, or *sponsored* (the accreditation service to providers who have no budget). 

  Paid membership gives the provider:
    - rebates from financial surplus
    - a say in governance (appointing a board member etc)
    - the knowledge that the platform is built to serve provider interests
    - access to the sector intelligence features that we sell to agencies.

  Paid memberships would not prevent us from offering tiered membership levels later with premium features later.

  In comparison to a Freemium model a mebership offers its likely that:
  1. We can begin offering membership as soon as we complete the accreditation flow MVP (November 2017). Compared to releasing premium features after we have finished phase 3 (July 2018 at the earlist)
  2. Membership will have a higher conversion rate than a premium offering 
  3. Membership fees will likely be lower than a premium subscriptions

  As an example with untested assumptions:
   - assuming 70 new providers sign up a month
   - a 10% conversion premium compared to a 70% membership conversion
   - a premium start date of July, 2018, vs a membership start of November, 2017
   - price of $25 / month for premium and $10 / month for 
  
  These give ~$3k of 2018 revenue from premium and ~$45k of revenue from membership fees, 






 

 Applying the Fairshares to Accreditron:

  - Founders
  - Employees
  - Users - Social Service Providers 
  - Investors - May include Founders, Employees, and Providers

### Users


## Governance

  In most Fairshares setups the Founders appoint the directors until the total number of sharholders is reached the business is established founders have 5 - 10% of shares
